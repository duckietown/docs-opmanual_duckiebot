# Duckiebot - `DB17-lc` configurations {#part:building-duckiebot-c1}

<!--
This section contains the acquisition, assembly and setup instructions for the `DB17-lc` configurations. These instructions are separate from the rest as they approximately match the `b` releases of the Fall 2017 Duckietown Engineering Co. branches.

To understand how configurations and releases are defined, refer to: [](#duckiebot-configurations).
-->

Note: We are currently revising the Duckiebot configurations for the upcoming semester, when Duckietown 1.0 will be officially released. Stay tuned!

TODO for Jacopo Tani: update configurations
