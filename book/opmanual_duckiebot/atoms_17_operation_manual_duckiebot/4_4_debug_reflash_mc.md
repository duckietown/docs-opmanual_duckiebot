# Debug - Reflash Microcontroller {#reflash-microcontroller status=ready}

This page is only for the DB18 and DB19 configuration (not the DB21M).

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: A Duckiebot.

Requires: A stable network connection to your Duckiebot.

Result: A flashed microcontroller (not SD card) on the HUT board with the latest code.

</div>

Warning: You must not procede with the following instructions unless you are in one of the following cases:
    1. The motors of the robot are not working.
    2. The LEDs are not white when the robot is switched on.
    3. You know what are you doing, or you have been asked to flash the microcontroller by someone who knows what the consequences can be.

first of all ssh into your Duckiebot running:

    laptop $ ssh duckie@DUCKIEBOT_NAME.local

Procede installing the packages needed to compile the firmware:

    duckiebot $ sudo apt-get update
    duckiebot $ sudo apt-get install bison autoconf flex gcc-avr binutils-avr gdb-avr avr-libc avrdude build-essential

If you are running a Duckiebot with an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board clone the firmware for the microcontroller using the following command:

    duckiebot $ git clone -b jetson-nano https://github.com/duckietown/fw-device-hut.git

else, if you have a Raspberri Pi based Duckiebot use:

    duckiebot $ git clone -b raspberry-pi https://github.com/duckietown/fw-device-hut.git

Navigate inside the repository you cloned and copy the avrdude config file in the `/etc` folder of the Duckiebot:

    duckiebot $ cd fw-device-hut
    duckiebot $ sudo cp _avrdudeconfig/avrdude.conf /etc/avrdude.conf

Then test the avrdude and set the fuses (these are some low-level settings, which just have to be set once) with:

    duckiebot $ make fuses

If the command was successful, namely, the connection to the microcontroller works and the fuses were written, the output looks like: 

    avrdude: verifying â€¦
    avrdude: 1 bytes of efuse verified

    avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:FF, H:DF, L:E2)


    avrdude done.  Thank you.

While in the case you see the `message make: warning: Clock skew detected. Your build may be incomplete.` or the process is not stopping, stop the process pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> and run:

    duckiebot $ find -exec touch \{\} \;

After that retry running the `make fuses` command.

Continue removing all temporary files, so everything has to be compiled freshly by running:

    duckiebot $ make clean

Then compile the firmware and upload it to the microcontroller by running:

    duckiebot $ make

the output should look like:

    .....

    sudo avrdude -p attiny861 -c linuxgpio -P  -q -U flash:w:main.hex

    avrdude done.  Thank you.

Finally remove the the repository to free up space on the robot and reboot the Duckiebot:

    duckiebot $ cd .. && rm -rf fw-device-hut
    duckiebot $ sudo reboot
