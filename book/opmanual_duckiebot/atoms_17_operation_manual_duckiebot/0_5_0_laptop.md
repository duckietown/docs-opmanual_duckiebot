## Minimal Laptop Requirements {#laptop-setup-reqs}

These installation steps make sure that you have a minimal "sane" environment, which includes:

1. Git and Git LFS;
2. Docker;
3. The Duckietown Shell.


## Native installation vs virtual machines {#laptop-setup-vms}

Having Ubuntu installed natively on your laptop is recommended but not strictly required.

If you are running Ubuntu in a VM make sure that you are using a Bridged network adapter (for example VirtualBox uses NAT by default). This allows you to be on the same subnetwork as your Duckiebot.

Sometimes when running a VMware machine in a Mac OS host, it is neccessary to have two network adapters: *Share with my Mac* for connecting to the internet and *Bridged Networking* for connecting to the Duckiebot.

TODO: give some pointers for VM.


## Setup for Ubuntu 18 {#laptop-setup-ubuntu-18}

### System installation {#laptop-setup-ubuntu-18-system}

Install Ubuntu 18.

See: For instructions, see for example [this online tutorial][tutorial].

[tutorial]: https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop

### Basic dependencies {#laptop-setup-ubuntu-18-basic}

Installs pip, git, git-lfs, curl, wget:

    laptop $ sudo apt install -y python3-pip git git-lfs curl wget

### Docker {#laptop-setup-ubuntu-18-docker}

Install Docker by following the instructions [here][docker_install].

[docker_install]:https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

Adds user to "docker" group:

    laptop $ sudo adduser `whoami` docker

Note: you need to *log out and in* for the group change take effect.


### Duckietown Shell {#laptop-setup-ubuntu-18-shell}

Follow the instructions in [repo README][shell_install].

[shell_install]:https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-shell


### Other suggested configuration

Other useful packages:

    laptop $ sudo apt install vim byobu openssh-server nfs-common zsh

Edit `~/.profile` and add:

    export EDITOR=vim

### Z shell

    $ sudo apt install zsh
    $ chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh

Install `oh-my-zsh`:

    $ sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"

Edit `~/.zshrc` and set a different theme using:

    ZSH_THEME="bureau"

You can find other themes [at this page](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes).

Also add the line:

    . ~/.profile


#### Passwordless sudo

To add passwordless sudo:

    laptop $ sudo visudo

Change the line

    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

into

    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

### Other packages useful for development


    $ sudo apt install iotop atop htop

### For virtual machines

For VMWare, install this:

    laptop $ sudo apt install open-vm-tools



## Setting up Mac OS X {#laptop-setup-mac}


Note: this configuration is not officially supported.

### Basic dependencies {#laptop-setup-mac-basic}

You will need to find the instructions for git, git-lfs.

### Quartz {#laptop-setup-mac-quartz}

You will also need the latest version of XQuartz.

You can install using `brew` as follows:


    laptop $ brew cask install xquartz


Or, download from [here](https://www.xquartz.org/) and follow the instructions.


After installing XQuartz, run it in the command line with:


    laptop $ open -a XQuartz


Go to "Preferences" and in the security tab make sure that the checkbox next to "Allow" connections from network clients is set. Now close XQuartz.

You may want to add the following lines to your `.bashrc` file:


    export IP=$(ifconfig en0 | grep inet | awk '$1=="inet" {print $2}')
    xhost +$IP
    
Note: You may also need to add `/usr/X11/bin` to your system path in order for it to find `xhost`. 

These will find your IP and then allow incoming connections to it in order to be able to popup windows from within docker containers.

Alternatively, you can run them each time before you want to use `X11` forwarding. This is done for you when you run things through the duckietown shell.


### Docker {#laptop-setup-mac-docker}

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

### Duckietown Shell {#laptop-setup-mac-shell}

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-shell)
Note: On OS X if you get a `Could not load commands` error when you run `dts` for the first time. Try deleting `~/.dt-shell/commands-multi/daffy/challenges/installed.flag` and running `dts` again.


## Setup for Ubuntu 16.04 {#laptop-setup-ubuntu-16}

Note: It is suggested to use Ubuntu 18.

### System installation {#laptop-setup-ubuntu-16-system}

Install Ubuntu 16.04.3.

See: For instructions, see for example [this online tutorial][tutorial].

[tutorial]: https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop

**On the choice of username:**  During the installation, create a user for yourself with a username different from `ubuntu`, which is the default. Otherwise, you may get confused later.


### Basic dependencies {#laptop-setup-ubuntu-16-deps}

Installs pip, git, git-lfs, docker, duckietown-shell:

    laptop $ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common  curl
    laptop $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
    laptop $ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
    laptop $ sudo apt-get install -y python-pip git git-lfs

### Docker {#laptop-setup-ubuntu-docker}

    laptop $ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo bash
    laptop $ sudo usermod -aG docker `whoami`

Note: you need to *log in and out* to have the group change take effect.


### Duckietown Shell {#laptop-setup-ubuntu-16-shell}

Install the Duckietown Shell using:

    laptop $ pip install --no-cache-dir -U --user duckietown-shell

Edit the file `~/.profile` and add the line:

    export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH

Note: do not use `sudo pip` to install the Duckietown Shell.


Log out and in. This command should succeed:

    laptop $ dts version
