## Find the Duckietown token {#dt-account-find-token}

The Duckietown Token allows to authenticate your devices to the Duckietown network.

The token is a string of letters and numbers that looks something like this:

    dt1-7vEuJsaxeXXXXX-43dzqWFnWd8KBa1yev1g3UKnzVxZkkTbfSJnxzuJjWaANeMf4y6XSXBWTpJ7vWXXXX

To find your token, first [login to duckietown.org](https://www.duckietown.org/pm_login), then open the page:

> [`https://www.duckietown.org/site/your-token`](https://www.duckietown.org/site/your-token)

Note: It may take up to 5 minutes after first creating your account for a token to be generated.

## Tell the Duckietown Shell your token {#dt-account-set-token}

Use the command

    laptop $ dts tok set

and follow the prompt.

Verify your token was successfully set by running the shell command,

    laptop $ dts tok status

You should see a message like the following,

    dts :  Correctly identified as uid = ***


## Troubleshooting

### "DTShell object has no attribute sprint" when using `dts tok set`

You have to completely reinstall `dts` and its commands. Do that by:

1. Delete the `~/.dt-shell` folder
2. Uninstall `dts` by running `pip uninstall duckietown-shell`
3. Reinstall `dts` by following the procedure in [Laptop Setup](#laptop-setup)


## Other Accounts {#dt-other-accounts}

### Github {#dt-account-github}

You will find it useful to have an acount on Github if you don't have one already. You can get one [here](https://github.com/join).
