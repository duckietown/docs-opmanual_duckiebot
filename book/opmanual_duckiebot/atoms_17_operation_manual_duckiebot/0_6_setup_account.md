## Sign up on the Duckietown website {#dt-account-register}

To register on the Duckietown website, go to:

> [`https://www.duckietown.org/site/register`](https://www.duckietown.org/site/register)

and click through to pick a community.

Note: If you are a student, please use your official student email address, so that you can be sorted in the right group.

## Find the Duckietown token {#dt-account-find-token}

The Duckietown Token allows to authenticate your devices to the Duckietown network.

The token is a string of letters and numbers that looks something like this:

    dt1-7vEuJsaxeXXXXX-43dzqWFnWd8KBa1yev1g3UKnzVxZkkTbfSJnxzuJjWaANeMf4y6XSXBWTpJ7vWXXXX

To find your token, first [login to duckietown.org](https://www.duckietown.org/pm_login), then open the page:

> [`https://www.duckietown.org/site/your-token`](https://www.duckietown.org/site/your-token)

Note: It may take up to 5 minutes after first creating your account for a token to be generated.

## Tell the Duckietown Shell your token {#dt-account-set-token}

Use the command

    laptop $ dts tok set

and follow the prompt.

Verify your token was successfully set by running the shell command,

    laptop $ dts tok status

You should see a message like the following,

    dts :  Correctly identified as uid = ***


Also make sure to tell the "challenges API" (needed if you are going to make submissions to the challenge server)  about your docker config:

    > dts challenges config --docker-username yourusername --docker-password yourpassword


## Verify everything is correct

Before we go on, this is a checkpoint to make sure you have installed everything.

If some of these commands donâ€™t work, please go back and fix it before continuing.

If the Docker installation went well, then you can run the following command:

    laptop $ docker run hello-world
    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

If you set up a Github account and private key, you should be able to run this command successfully:

    laptop $ ssh -T git@github.com
    Hi GITHUB_USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
    
If you have a valid DockerHub account then you can login as follows.

    laptop $ docker login -u DOCKER_USERNAME
    Password:

If the Duckietown Shell was installed, then you can run a command like this:

    laptop $ dts version

If you correctly configured the token, then this command should work:

    laptop $ dts challenges info
    ~        You are successfully authenticated:
    ~
    ~                     ID: YOUR ID
    ~                   name: YOUR NAME
    ~                  login: YOUR DUCKIETOWN ACCOUNT 
    ~
    ~         You can find the list of your submissions at the page:
    ~
    ~              https://challenges.duckietown.org/v4/humans/users/YOUR ID

If there is something not working, please stop here. Ask for help on Stack Overflow.



## Troubleshooting

### "DTShell object has no attribute sprint" when using `dts tok set`

You have to completely reinstall `dts` and its commands. Do that by:

1. Delete the `~/.dt-shell` folder
2. Uninstall `dts` by running `pip uninstall duckietown-shell`
3. Reinstall `dts` by following the procedure in [Laptop Setup](#laptop-setup)


## Other Accounts {#dt-other-accounts}

### Github {#dt-account-github}

You will find it useful to have an acount on Github if you don't have one already. You can get one [here](https://github.com/join).
