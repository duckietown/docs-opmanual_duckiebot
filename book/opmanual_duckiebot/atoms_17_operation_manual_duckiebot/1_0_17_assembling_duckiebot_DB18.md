## What is in the box {#bom-db18}

All the pieces in your Duckiebox are shown in [](#fig:duckiebot-components-db18). Note that you might have a different battery than in the picture, or different USB to micro USB cables, but the instructions can be followed anyway.

<div figure-id="fig:duckiebot-components-db18" figure-caption="Components in Duckiebot package.">
     <img src="duckiebot_components_db18.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

If you have got extra pieces, such as an extra heat sink or screws and nuts, just keep them apart, they could turn out to be useful in the future!

### Preliminary Steps

### Step A

Unbox all of your components, and put aside anything that is not shown in [](#fig:duckiebot-components-db18). You might have some redundant components like a black battery holder and motor encoders, in addition to spares.

### Step B

Take the rear bumper bracers and the back bumper. The back bumper will be mounted in the last steps as a press fit to the rear bumper bracers. Try to fit the bracers into the holes of the back bumper.

Some bumper bracers have a plastic protective film which is a residue of the manufacturing process. If you struggle in the press fitting, peel off the plastic cover from *one* side of the bracer. If this does not help, peel off the plastic cover from both sides.

### Step C

Peel the plastic cover from all the chassis parts (except the bumper bracers) on both sides.

### Step D

Note that two amongst all of your metal screws are special. They are "countersunk" screws. Keep these aside. They will be needed in [Part 15: Back bumper assembly](#howto-mount-back-bumper).

<div figure-id="fig:countersunk-screws-db18" figure-caption="Countersunk screws have a tapered head.">
     <img src="countersunk-screws-db18.jpg" style='width: 35em'/>
</div>

## Motors {#howto-mount-motors-db18}

From the Duckiebox package take the following components:

- Chassis-bottom (1x)
- DC Motors (2x)
- Motor holders (4x)
- M3x30 screw (4x)
- M3 nuts (4x)

[](#fig:howto-mount-motors-parts-db18) shows the components needed to complete this part of the tutorial.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motors-parts-db18" figure-caption="Components needed to mount the motors.">
     <img src="howto_mount_motors_parts.jpg" style='width: 35em'/>
</div>



### Step 1

Pass two of the motor holders through the openings in the bottom plate of the chassis as shown
in [](#fig:howto-mount-motors-1). If you have troubles fitting the holders, it is probably because you have not removed the protective plastic film.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motors-1" figure-caption="How to mount the motor holders.">
     <img src="howto-mount-motors-1.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>


### Step 2

Put one motor between the holders as shown in [](#fig:howto-mount-motors-2).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motors-2" figure-caption="The sketch of how to mount a motor.">
  <img src="howto-mount-motors-2.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

Note: Orient the motors so that their wires are inwards (i.e., towards the center of the plate).

Note: Use your screwdriver.


### Step 3

Use *2* M3x30 screws and *2* M3 nuts to secure the motor to the motor holders. Pass the screws through the holes from the outside inwards, then tighten the screws
to secure the holders to the bottom plate of the chassis as shown in [](#fig:howto-mount-motors-3).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motors-3" figure-caption="The sketch of how to secure a motor to the bottom plate.">
   <img src="howto-mount-motors-3.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

Note: tighten the motors firmly, as a wobbly motor might cause troubles later on.

### Step 4

Repeat for the opposite side and check that the outcome is the same as in [](#fig:howto-mount-motors-milestone-db18).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motors-milestone-db18" figure-caption="The motors are attached to the bottom plate of the chassis.">
   <img src="howto-mount-motors-milestone-db18.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

### Step 5

Tilt your bottom plate and pass the cables of the motors through the central hole. Keep the cables coming from each motor separated ([](#fig:howto-mount-motors-4)).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motors-4" figure-caption="Cables through central hole.">
   <img src="howto-mount-motors-4.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>



## Omni-directional wheel {#howto-mount-omniwheel-db18}

The Duckiebot is driven by controlling the wheels attached to the DC motors.
Still, it requires a _passive_ support on the back. In this configuration an omni-directional wheel is
attached to the bottom plate of the chassis to provide such support.

From the Duckiebox package take the following components:

- Steel omni-directional wheel (1x)
- M3x25 metal spacers (2x)
- M3x10 (or M3x8) screws (2x)


[](#fig:howto-mount-omniwheel-parts-db18) shows the components needed to complete this part of the tutorial.

</div>


## Chassis assembly {#howto-assemble-chassis}

From the previously prepared pieces take the following components:

- Assembled top chassis (1x)
- Assembled bottom chassis (1x)

From the Duckiebot kit take the following components:

- M3x10 screws (2x)
- Back bumper bracer (1x)

[](#fig:howto-assemble-chassis-parts) shows the components needed to complete this part of the tutorial.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-assemble-chassis-parts" figure-caption="The parts needed to add the battery to the Duckiebot.">
     <img src="howto_assemble_chassis_parts.png" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>



### Step 1

Place the top chassis assembly over the bottom chassis assembly as in [](#fig:howto-assemble-chassis-1).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-assemble-chassis-1" figure-caption="The parts needed to add the battery to the Duckiebot.">
     <img src="howto_assemble_chassis_1.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

### Step 2

Note: The following is a tricky step. We suggest to align your chackras and read the procedure through before starting.

For each motor, the cable that is soldered closer to the floor (bottom), goes on the *external* connection. The cable soldered on the motor on the plate side goes on the *internal* connection.

Insert the *right*-motor cable on the *right* side of the Hut connector ([](#fig:howto-assemble-chassis-2) perspective), and the *left*-motor cable on the *left* side of the Hut connector.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-assemble-chassis-2" figure-caption="Example for the connection.">
     <img src="howto_assemble_chassis_2.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

For reference, look at the example in [](#fig:howto-wire-motors-db18), where the *left* motor (driving perspective) has the *red* wire soldered on the bottom, so it goes on the *external left* connector. Similarly, the *right* motor (driving perspective) has the *black* wire soldered on the bottom, so it goes on the *external right* connector.


<div figure-id="fig:howto-wire-motors-db18" figure-caption="Explicative image.">
     <img src="howto_wire_motors_db18.png" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

You might find it easier to temporarily remove the USB cables while executing this passage. Make sure that you plug them back in before moving to the next one though.

### Step 3

Now flip the chassis top plate assembly, it should look like in [](#fig:howto-assemble-chassis-4).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-assemble-chassis-4" figure-caption="How should the chassis look like.">
     <img src="howto_assemble_chassis_4.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

### Step 4

Place the second rear bumper bracer on top of the chassis spacers in the back of the chassis, again the holes should align ([](#fig:howto-assemble-chassis-5)). If you experience a slight misalignment, carefully pass an M3 screw through the top plate and the top bumper bracer first, then move the standoff until you can plug the screw in.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-assemble-chassis-5" figure-caption="Rear bumper bracer positioning.">
     <img src="howto_assemble_chassis_5.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

### Step 5

Fasten the top plate using the M3x10 screws, as in([](#fig:howto-assemble-chassis-6).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-assemble-chassis-6" figure-caption="How to fasten the chassis.">
     <img src="howto_assemble_chassis_6.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

### Step 6

You can use a zip tie to help with cable management ([](#fig:howto-assemble-chassis-7)). Tip: you can use one zipties to keep the camera cable down and the USB cables below from touching the wheels.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-assemble-chassis-7" figure-caption="Cable management.">

## Circle grid holder {#howto-mount-circlegrid-holder}

From the Duckiebot kit take the following components:

- Back bumper (1x)
- M3x10 nylon screws (2x)
- M3x10 countersunk screws (2x)
- M3x25 spacers (2x)
- Back plate (1x)
- Circle pattern sticker (1x)

[](#fig:howto-mount-circlegrid-holder-parts) shows the components needed to complete this upgrade.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-circlegrid-holder-parts" figure-caption="The parts needed to mount the circle grid holder.">
     <img src="howto_mount_circlegrid_holder_parts.png" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

Note: You could have a back plate of a different color with respect to the picture, e.g., black or white. THey are all functionally equivalent.

### Step 1

Mount the spacers using the nylon screws, as in [](#fig:howto-mount-circlegrid-holder-1).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-circlegrid-holder-1" figure-caption="How to mount the spacers.">
     <img src="howto_mount_circlegrid_holder_1.png" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

Note: pay attention that the spacers should be in the same direction as the LEDs.

### Step 2

Take the back plate and place the countersunk screws on the side where the holes are tapered, as shown in [](#fig:howto-mount-circlegrid-holder-2).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-circlegrid-holder-2" figure-caption="How to mount the spacers.">
     <img src="howto_mount_circlegrid_holder_2.png" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>


### Step 3

Fasten the back plate to the back bumper standoffs, like shown in the picture. The back plate is not symmetric, place it such that it is centered with respect to the back bumper. Then apply the circle pattern sticker to the back plate ([](#fig:howto-mount-circlegrid-holder-3)).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-circlegrid-holder-3" figure-caption="How to the sticker.">
     <img src="howto_mount_circlegrid_holder_3.png" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>



## Front bumper assembly {#howto-mount-front-bumper}

From the previously prepared pieces take the following components:

- Assembled chassis (1x)

From the Duckiebot kit take the following components:

- Front bumper (1x)
- Set of three female to female jumper wires (1x)
- M3x6 Screws (2x)

[](#fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-parts) shows the components needed to complete this upgrade.

Note: It is cleaner if you do not separate each cable, but leave them in two sets of three.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-parts" figure-caption="The parts needed to mount the front bumper.">
     <img src="howto_mount_front_bumper_parts.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>



### Step 1
Place the front bumper in front of the chassis. Then locate the pins on the front bumper, you should have taken note of the connection you have done on the Duckietown Hut ([](#fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-1)).

Note: Pay attention to place the front bumper oriented as in the picture.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-1" figure-caption="The parts needed to mount the front bumper.">
     <img src="howto_mount_front_bumper_1.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

### Step 2

Pass the electric F/F cables through the top chassis for cable management purposes. Try avoid any cable from touching the wheels ([](#fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-2)).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-2" figure-caption="Cable management.">
     <img src="howto_mount_front_bumper_2.png" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

Note: The ziptie can be in a different position than shown in the picture.

### Step 3

Now we need to connect the two set of wires to the front bumper.
The set of cables coming from the Raspberry Pi must be connected on the right ([](#fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-3) perspective, namely the green blue and yellow wires in the picture), while the connector on the left (red white and black wires in the picture) will go to the back bumper. Again take note of which color you used for which pin in the left connector.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-3" figure-caption="Front bumper connections.">
     <img src="howto_mount_front_bumper_3.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

### Step 5

Place the cabled front bumper in front of the chassis, with your fingers slightly lift the top plate and insert the front bumper. It is a form fit, the connector on the lower part must go in the circular hole (see [](#fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-5)), while the two top connectors will lock in just behind the camera mount (refer to [](#fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-6)). You might need to apply some pressure once found the correct alignment for the components to "lock in".

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-5" figure-caption="Front bumper bottom part placement.">
     <img src="howto_mount_front_bumper_5.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-front-bumper-6" figure-caption="Front bumper upper part placement..">
     <img src="howto_mount_front_bumper_6.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

#### Part 6

Insert and fasten the screws trough the top plate in the front chassis spacers.


## Back bumper assembly {#howto-mount-back-bumper}

From the previously prepared assemblies, and from the Duckiebox, take the following components:

- Assembled chassis (1x)
- Back bumper assembly (1x)
- (Optional) M3 screws (2x) and nuts.

[](#fig:howto-mount-back-bumper-parts) shows the components needed to complete this upgrade.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-back-bumper-parts" figure-caption="The parts needed to mount the back bumper.">
     <img src="howto_mount_back_bumper_parts.png" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

### Step 1

Place the back bumper as shown in [](#fig:howto-mount-back-bumper-1), then connect the wires to the back bumper according to the connection done in the front bumper.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-back-bumper-1" figure-caption="How to place the back bumper assembly.">
     <img src="howto_mount_back_bumper_1.png" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

### Step 2

The back bumper is press fit to the bumper bracers, place it as in [](#fig:howto-mount-back-bumper-3). You will have to apply little pressure, and it should fit tightly.

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-back-bumper-3" figure-caption="How to fix the back bumper.">
     <img src="howto_mount_back_bumper_3.png" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

If you cannot get the bumper to fit, check if the bumper bracer has plastic protective films on both sides. In case, remove one - try again - and in case remove the other one too.

If you experience a loose fit instead, you can use two M3 screws and nuts to secure the back bumper.

## Battery and Duckie {#howto-mount-battery-duckie}

From the previously prepared pieces take the following components:

- Assembled chassis (1x)

From the Duckiebot kit take the following components:

- Battery (1x)
- Zip tie (1x)
- Duckie (N+1x)

[](#fig:howto-mount-battery-duckie-parts) shows the components needed to complete this tutorial.

     <img src="howto_mount_battery_duckie_parts.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

### Step 1

Place the battery and fix it using a zip tie, then connect the USB cables, as in [](#fig:howto-mount-battery-duckie-1).

Note: **Do not** unplug/replug the bumper wires when the power is on. You could break the bumpers!

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-battery-duckie-1" figure-caption="The parts needed to mount the battery.">
     <img src="howto_mount_battery_duckie_1.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

### Step 2

Place the Duckie on top of your brand new Duckiebot.

Note: Be careful not to hurt the Duckie.

### Check the outcome

[](#fig:howto-assemble-finish-milestone) and [](#fig:howto-assemble-finish-milestone-2) show how the final assembly should look like. Congratulations!

<div figure-id="fig:howto-assemble-finish-milestone" figure-caption="The final Duckiebot assembly, with shorter form factor battery.">
   <img src="howto_assemble_finish_milestone.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>

   <img src="howto_assemble_finish_milestone-2.jpg" style='width: 25em'/>
</div>

Note: as a final check, verify that no cable is touching the wheels. You can use the provided zip ties to ensure that cables stay out of the way.

## FAQ {#op-assembly-db18-faq}

Q: I found it hard to mount the omni-directional wheel / the back bumper / the Raspberry Pi because the holes weren't lining up.

A: Sometimes in life you have to push a little to make things happen. (But don't push too much or things will break!)

Q: My battery is different from the one shown in the pictures! Did I get the wrong box?

A: If there is a duckie in or on your box, you most probably got the right one. We support different battery models. All supported models are functionally equivalent, although the form factor varies.
