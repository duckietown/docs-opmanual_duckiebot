## Preliminary Steps {#howto-preliminary-db21m}

### Unboxing
Unbox all of your components and lay them out on a flat surface. Ensure that you have well lit, uncluttered space to work on.

Although not necessary, you might find useful getting a small (M2.5) wrench to ease some of the passages.

### Plastic cover
Peel the plastic cover from all the chassis parts (except the bumper bracers) on both sides.

TODO: add picture for removing plastic cover

### Screws, Nuts and Stand-offs
Each type of screw, nut and stand-off has its own number. You will find the corresponding number on the picture of each step. Make sure to always use the right parts (e.g. nylon screws prevent electrical short circuits). Otherwise, your Duckiebot may not be fully functional.

Remember that instructions are your friend! At least at this stage, try to follow them precisely. The [FAQ](#op-faq-db21) section at the bottom of this page might be the first thing to visit if something is not clear. This may already answer your comments, questions or doubts.


If regardless of this foreword you still choose to try and figure it out yourself, it's ok, but for the love of what is precious, *do not plug the battery in until you have performed a visual inspection* [here](#db21-visual-inspection).  


## Driving Units {#howto-driving-unit-db21m}
From the Duckiebox package take the following components:

TODO: add picture for part overview of steps 1-12

Q: CAMERA CABLE: I had to twist the cable of the camera by 180 degrees in order to make the pins on the cable matching the pins in the connector (facing the back side of the robot). Is this normal?

A: Yes this is normal! It might look a little nicer if you wire the camera cable around the metal stand-off next to the plug.
