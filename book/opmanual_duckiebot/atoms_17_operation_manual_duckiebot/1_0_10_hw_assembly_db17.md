<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motorhat-video">
    <dtvideo src="vimeo:236334482"/>
</div>

### Step-by-step guide

#### Step 1

Connect the wires of the USB power cable to the terminal block on the DC Stepper Motor HAT labeled as
"5-12V Motor Power" as shown in [](#fig:howto-mount-motorhat-cable).
The black wire goes to the negative terminal block (labeled with a minus: `-`) and the red wire goes to the
positive terminal block (labeled with a plus: `+`).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motorhat-cable" figure-caption="How to connect the USB power cable to
the DC Stepper Motor HAT.">
     <img src="howto_mount_motorhat_cable.jpg" style='width: 30em'/>
</div>

#### Step 2

Pass the free end of the camera cable through the opening in the DC Stepper Motor HAT as shown in [](#fig:howto-mount-motorhat-camera).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motorhat-camera" figure-caption="How to pass the camera cable through
the opening in the DC Stepper Motor HAT.">
     <img src="howto_mount_motorhat_camera.jpg" style='width: 30em'/>
</div>

#### Step 3

Connect the free end of the camera cable to the **CAMERA** port on the Raspberry Pi 3 as shown
in [](#fig:howto-mount-motorhat-connect-camera).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motorhat-connect-camera" figure-caption="How to connect the camera cable to
the CAMERA port on the Raspberry Pi 3.">
    <img src="howto_mount_motorhat_connect_camera.jpg" style='width: 30em'/>
</div>

To do so, you will need to gently pull up on the black connector (it will slide up) to allow the cable to
insert the port. Slide the connector back down to lock the cable in place, making sure it “clicks”.

Note: Make sure the camera cable is inserted in the right direction! The metal pins of the cable must
be in contact with the metal terminals in the camera port of the PI. Please be aware that different camera
cables have the text on different sides and with different orientation, **do not** use it as a landmark.

#### Step 4

Attach the DC Stepper Motor HAT to the GPIO header on the Raspberry Pi 3.
Make sure that the GPIO stacking header of the Motor HAT is carefully aligned with the underlying GPIO pins
before applying pressure.

Note: In case you are using a short camera cable, ensure that the camera cable does not stand between the
GPIO pins and the the GPIO header socket before applying pressure.

#### Step 5

Secure the DC Stepper Motor HAT using *4* M2.5x10 nylon screws.

Note: If you are planning on upgrading your Duckiebot to the configuration `DB17-l`, you can use *4* M2.5x12
nylon standoffs instead.

#### Step 6

Connect the motor wires to the terminal block on the DC Stepper Motor HAT as shown
in [](#fig:howto-mount-motorhat-motors).

<div figure-id="fig:howto-mount-motorhat-motors" figure-caption="How to connect the motor wires to the
terminal block on the DC Stepper Motor HAT.">
     <img src="howto_mount_motorhat_motors.jpg" style='width: 30em'/>
</div>

While looking at the Duckiebot from the back, identify the wires for left and right motor. Connect the
left motor wires to the terminals labeled as **M1** and the right motor wires to the terminals labeled
as **M2**. This will ensure that the pre-existing software that we will later install on the Duckiebot
will send the commands to the correct motors.

### FAQ {#op-assembly-db17wjd-faq}

Q: If we have the bumpers, at what point should we add them?

A: You shouldn't have the bumpers at this point. The function of the bumpers is to keep the LEDs in place, i.e., they belong to `DB17-l` configuration. These instructions cover the `DB17-wjd` configurations. You will find the bumper assembly instructions in [](#bumper-assembly).

Q: Yeah but I still have the bumpers and am reading this page. So?

A: The bumpers can be added after the Duckiebot assembly is complete.

Q: I found it hard to mount the camera (the holes weren't lining up).

A: Sometimes in life you have to push a little to make things happen. (But don't push too much or things will break!)

Q: The long camera cable is a bit annoying - I folded it and shoved it in between two hats.

A: The shorter cable is even more annoying. We suggest wrapping the long camera cable between the chassis and the Raspberry Pi. With some strategic planning, you can use the zipties that keep the battery in place to hold the camera cable in place as well.

Q: I need something to cut the end of the zip tie with.

A: Scissors typically work out for these kind of jobs (and no, they're not provided in a Fall 2017 Duckiebox).

## Assembly instructions (`DB17`): soldering {#assembling-duckiebot-db17-soldering status=ready}

Note: It is better to be safe than sorry. Soldering is a potentially hazardous activity. There is a fire hazard as well as the risk of inhaling toxic fumes. Stop a second and make sure you are addressing the safety standards for soldering when following these instructions. If you have never soldered before, seek advice.

In this instruction set we will assume you have soldered something before and are acquainted with the soldering fundamentals. If not, before proceeding, read this great tutorial on soldering:

See: [Alternative instructions: how to solder on Headers and Terminal Block](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dc-and-stepper-motor-hat-for-raspberry-pi/assembly)

Note: Very general tips in soldering

* solder the components according to their height - from lowest to highest.

* soldering is potentially dangerous - prepare a clean, well lit and aerated working place before starting.

* It's ok to ask for help! Especially is you have never soldered before.

2. Slide the battery between the two chassis plates

3. Power the PWM/Servo HAT and Pi connecting them to the battery with the cables included in the duckiebox

4. Power the DC/Stepper motor from the PWM/Servo HAT using the male-to-male cable in the duckiebox, connect the positive

5. connect the Pi to the board

6. Done!

### Assembly instructions (`DB17-jwd`): power cable {#assembling-duckiebot-db17-cable-splitting status=ready}

In configuration `DB17` we will need a cable to power the DC motor HAT from the battery. The keen observer might have noticed that such a cable was not included in the [`DB17` Duckiebot parts](#db-opmanual-get-db17) chapter. Here, we create this cable by splitting open any USB-A cable, identifying and stripping the power wires, and using them to power the DC motor HAT. If you are unsure about the definitions of the different Duckiebot configurations, read [](#duckiebot-configurations).

It is important to note that these instructions are relevant only for assembling a `DB17-wjdc` configuration Duckiebot (or any subset of it). If you intend to build a `DB17-l` configuration Duckiebot, you can skip these instructions.

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: One male USB-A to anything cable.

Requires: A pair of scissors.

Requires: A multimeter (only if you are not purchasing the [suggested components](#db-opmanual-get-db17))

Requires: Time: 5 minutes

Results: One male USB-A to wires power cable

</div>

#### Video tutorial

The following video shows how to prepare the USB power cable for the configuration `DB17`.

<div figure-id="fig:prepare-usb-cable">
    <dtvideo src="vimeo:236334476"/>
</div>

#### Step 1: Find a cable

To begin with, find a male USB-A to anything cable.

If you have purchased the suggested components listed in [](#get-db-hw), you can use the longer USB cable contained inside the battery package ([](#figure:battery-pack-usb-cables)), which will be used as an example in these instructions.

<div figure-id="fig:battery-pack-usb-cables" figure-caption="The two USB cables in the suggested battery pack.">
     <img src="battery-pack-usb-cables.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

Put the shorter cable back in the box, and open the longer cable ([](#figure:long-usb-cable))

<div figure-id="fig:long-usb-cable" figure-caption="Take the longer cable, and put the shorter on back in the box.">
     <img src="long-usb-cable.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

#### Step 2: Cut the cable

<div class="check" markdown="1">
Make sure the USB cable is _unplugged_ from any power source before proceeding.
</div>

 Take the scissors and cut it ([](#figure:cut-the-cable)) at the desired length from the USB-A port.

<div figure-id="fig:cut-the-cable" figure-caption="Cut the USB cable using the scissors.">
     <img src="cut-the-cable.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

The cut will look like in [](#figure:the-cable-cut).

<div figure-id="fig:the-cable-cut" figure-caption="A cut USB cable.">
     <img src="the-cable-cut.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

#### Step 3: Strip the cable

Paying attention not to get hurt, strip the external white plastic. A way to do so without damaging the wires is shown in [](#figure:stripping-the-outside).

<div figure-id="fig:stripping-the-outside" figure-caption="Stripping the external layer of the USB cable.">
     <img src="stripping-the-outside.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

After removing the external plastic, you will see four wires: black, green, white and red ([](#figure:under-the-hood)).

<div figure-id="fig:under-the-hood" figure-caption="Under the hood of a USB-A cable.">
     <img src="under-the-hood.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

Once the bottom part of the external cable is removed, you will have isolated the four wires ([](#figure:stripped-the-outside)).

<div figure-id="fig:stripped-the-outside" figure-caption="The four wires inside a USB-A cable.">
     <img src="stripped-the-outside.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

#### Step 4: Strip the wires {#strip-the-power-wires}

<div class="check" markdown="1">
Make sure the USB cable is _unplugged_ from any power source before proceeding.
</div>

Once you have isolated the wires, strip them, and use the scissors to cut off the data wires (green and white, central positions) ([](#figure:strip-power-wires)).

<div figure-id="fig:strip-power-wires" figure-caption="Strip the power wires and cut the data wires.">
     <img src="strip-power-wires.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

If you are not using the suggested cable, or want to verify which are the data and power wires, continue reading.

#### Step 5: Find the power wires

If you are using the USB-A cable from the suggested battery pack, black and red are the power wires and green and white are instead for data.

If you are using a different USB cable, or are curious to verify that black and red actually are the power cables, take a multimeter and continue reading.

Plug the USB port inside a power source, e.g., the Duckiebot's battery. You can use some scotch tape to keep the cable from moving while probing the different pairs of wires with a multimeter. The voltage across the pair of power cables will be roughly twice the voltage between a power and data cable. The pair of data cables will have no voltage differential across them. If you are using the suggested Duckiebot battery as power source, you will measure around 5V across the power cables ([](#figure:testing-voltage-usb-cable-power-wires)).

<div figure-id="fig:testing-voltage-usb-cable-power-wires" figure-caption="Finding which two wires are for power.">
     <img src="testing-voltage-usb-cable-power-wires.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

#### Step 6: Test correct operation

You are now ready to secure the power wires to the DC motor HAT power pins. To do so though, you need to have soldered the boards first. If you have not done so yet, read [](#assembling-duckiebot-db17-soldering).

If you have soldered the boards already, you may test correct functionality of the newly crafted cable. Connect the battery with the DC motor HAT by making sure you plug the black wire in the pin labeled with a minus: `-` and the red wire to the plus: `+` ([](#figure:final-result-power-c0)).

<div figure-id="fig:final-result-power-c0" figure-caption="Connect the power wires to the DC motor HAT">
     <img src="final-result-power-c0.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

## Bumper Assembly {#bumper-assembly status=ready}

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: Duckiebot `DB17-lc` parts.

Requires: Having the Duckiebot with configuration `DB17-wjd` assembled. The assembly process is explained in [](#assembling-duckiebot-db17jwd).

Requires: Time: about 15 minutes.

Results: A Duckiebot with Bumpers (configuration DB17-l2)

</div>

### Locate all required parts

The following should be included in your parts envelope (See image below for these components):

* 1x front bumper (Camera side)
* 1x rear bumper (the side of Caster/Omnidirectional wheel)
* 2x rear bumper brace (the side of Caster/Omnidirectional wheel)
* 8x M2.5x10 nylon or metal screws
* 8x M2.5 nuts

The following is not included in your parts envelope but will be needed for assembly:

* Small screwdriver

<div figure-id="fig:components-package" figure-caption="Components in Duckiebot package.">
    <img src="Bumpers.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

<div figure-id="fig:screws_for_bumper" figure-caption= "screws for fasten the bumpers">
    <img src="screws_bumpers.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

### Reminder: Use care when assembling! {#assembly-with-care-db17}

 Use care when assembling, make sure to be gentle! Tighten screws just enough so that the parts will remain stationary. When inserting LEDs, gently work them into their holders. While the acrylic is relatively tough, it can be fractured with modest force. We don’t have many replacements (at this moment) so we may not be able to replace a broken part.

#### Remove protective paper

Peel protective layer off of all parts on all sides.

<div figure-id="fig:remove_schild" figure-caption= "Bumpers with its protective layer">
    <img src="remove_schild.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>


### Assembly Rear Spacers

#### Disassembly the spacers between the both chassis

The backside of duckiebot before assemblying the bumpers looks as [](#fig:before_bumpers):
<div figure-id="fig:before_bumpers" figure-caption= "The configuration before assemblying the bumpers">
    <img src="before_bumpers.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Now remove the spacers and the (short)metall screws from the standoffs (configuration 'DB17-wjd') and replace it with 4 M3x10 nylon screws for connecting the chassis and the bumper spacers.

<div figure-id="fig:screw_for_upgrade" figure-caption= "The spacers configuration for the bumpers, Left: old configuration, Right: new configuration">
    <img src="screwForUpgrade.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

<!--Disassemble the rear spacers. KEEP ALL HARDWARE (you will be using the 2 short screws that were connected to the bottom of the spacer later). Reassemble in the configuration shown in the images below (note that the rear bumper braces now act as spacers to preserve the height offset). Reinstall the longer M2.5 screws that were originally connected at the top, and replace the bottom screws with 2 of your M3x10 screws included in the envelope. You may need the pliers to grasp the hex spacers when tightening. Note [Reminder: Use care when assembling!](#assembly-with-care-db17) -->

M3x10 screws attaching bottom rear brace:

<div figure-id="fig:bottom_rear_brace" figure-caption= "Attach the spacers with M3*10 nylone screws">
    <img src="bottom_rear_brace.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Back View, fully assembled:

<div figure-id="fig:back_view_fully_assembled" figure-caption="Back view of rear spacers">
    <img src="back_view_fully_assembled.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Note: For the ETH students, the M3*10 nylon screws for attaching the rear spacers with chassis were already distributed during the duckiebot ceremony and not included in second distribution. Please reuse them!

#### Mount Rear Bumper

Carefully guide rear bumper on to rear bumper brace tabs. Ensure that the hole for charging aligns with the charging port on your battery.

<div figure-id="fig:rear_bumpers" figure-caption="Front view of rear bumper">
    <img src="rear_bumpers.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Locate 4 M2.5 nylon/metall nuts and 4 M2.5*10 nylon screws. Place a nut in the wide part of the t-slot and thread a screw into the nut as shown in the following pictures. Note [Use care when assembling!](#assembly-with-care-db17) If you are having trouble with the nuts falling out, take a small piece of transparent tape and place it over both sides of the t-slot with the nut inside. It won’t look as nice but it will be much easier to assemble.

Better: Test the screws and the nuts once by screwing them together before you use it for the bumpers. It make the fllowing assembly process much easier.

Note: For ETH 2017, the screws and nuts using for this step are M2.5*10 nylon screws (white) and M2.5 nylon or metall nuts from the envelope.

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_screw1" figure-caption = "Hold the nuts with the fingers">
    <img src="bumper_screw1.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>
<div figure-id="fig:bumper_screw2" figure-caption = "Screw the screws into nuts while holding the nuts with the fingers">
    <img src="bumper_screw2.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>


The completed rear bumper should look like this:

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_12" figure-caption = "Completed rear bumpers">
    <img src="image_12-1.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Congrats! your rear bumper assembly is complete!

#### Mount Front Bumper

The front side of Duckiebot in `DB17-wjd` should look like in [](#fig:frontside_before_bumper).

Take 2x M2.5*10 nylon screws and 2x M2.5 nylon nuts and install them as shown in the following pictures. The first picture shows the correct holes to mount these screws (The correct position is the widest pair of 3mm holes beside the camera). The nuts should tightened on by a few threads (these are the two nuts that are not yet tightened at the top of the second picture):

<div figure-id="fig:frontside_before_bumper" figure-caption="Front side of configuration DB17-wjd, without bumpers">
    <img src="frontside_before_bumper.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Better: Before tighten the front bumper, you should organize the wires of LEDs going through the right holes of chassis. The center LED should be bent at a right angle in the direction that the wire is fed through the body.

Take the front bumper and carefully press the LEDs into the bumper holders. Take care that the wires are routed behind the front bumper. Also note that the front center LED wire should not be crushed between the bumper and the right spacer (you will likely fracture the bumper if you try to force it). The center LED should be bent at a right angle in the direction that the wire is fed through the body (see [](#fig:front_bumper_LED)).

<div figure-id="fig:front_bumper_LED" figure-caption="Insert the LEDs before tighten the front bumper.">
    <img src="front_bumper_LED.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Position the bumper so that the nuts align with the t-slots. You may need to loosen or tigthen the screws to align the nuts. You may also need to angle the front bumper when inserting to get it
past the camera screws.

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_17" figure-caption = "Completed front bumpers">
    <img src="front_bumper_LED2.jpg" style='width:30em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Gently tighten the nuts. The front bumper should now stay in position.

Use the long wires with two female ends. Attach one to each of the pins on the LED.

To figure out the order to connect them to the LSD hat, use the legend on the silkscreen and the information above. i.e. RX - means the red pin, CX - means the common, GX means the green, and BX means the blue. The "X" varies in number from 1-5 depending on which LED is being connected as discussed in the next section.

</div>

Better: Use Tape to keep the LEDs stick with the wires.

### Connecting LEDs to LSD Hat

Silkscreen legend: Rx, Gx, Bx are red, green, and blue channels, accordingly, where x is the LED number; C is a common line (either common anode or common cathode).


Define the following names for the lights:

* “top” = top light  - the “top” light is now at the bottom
* fl  = front left
* fr  = front right
* br = back right
* bl = back left


The LEDs are wired according to [](#fig:LED_connections).

    <img src="LED_connections.png" style='width:20em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Mappings from the numbers on the LED hats to the positions shown (TOP is now the one in the middle at the front)

* FR -> 5
* BR -> 4
* TOP -> 3
* BL -> 2
* FL -> 1

### Running the Wires Through the Chassis

It is advised that the LED cables are routed through the positions noted in the images below before installing the bumpers:

Front Left, Front Middle, and Front Right LED Wiring suggestion:

</div>


### Final tweaks

Adjust the LED terminals (particularly in the front) so that they do not interfere with the wheels. This can be accomplished by bending them up, away from the treads.
