## How to get help {nonumber=1 notoc=1}

There are three ways to get help:

1. Join the [Duckietown Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/duckietown/shared_invite/enQtNTU0Njk4NzU2NTY1LWM2YzdlNmJmOTg4MzAyODc2YTI3YTc5MzE2MThkZGUwYTFkZWQ4M2ZlZGU1YTZhYjg5YTgzNDkyMzI2ZjNhZWE), `#how-to-get-help` channel (or a more appropriate one depending on the specificity of your question).

2. If you are not familiar with Git, use the "Ask a question on the website" link at the end of each page. This creates a question on [the questions part][questions] of the website.  

3. If you are familiar with Git, you can [create an issue for this repository][issues].
