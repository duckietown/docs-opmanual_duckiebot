## Sign up on the Duckietown website {#dt-account-register}

To register on the Duckietown website, go to:

> [`https://www.duckietown.org/site/register`](https://www.duckietown.org/site/register)

and click through to pick a community. 

Note: If you are a student, please use your official student email address, so that you can be sorted in the right group.

## Find the Duckietown token {#dt-account-find-token}

The Duckietown Token allows to authenticate your devices to the Duckietown network.

The token is a string of letters and numbers that looks something like this:

    dt1-7vEuJsaxeXXXXX-43dzqWFnWd8KBa1yev1g3UKnzVxZkkTbfSJnxzuJjWaANeMf4y6XSXBWTpJ7vWXXXX

To find your token, first login to duckietown.org, then open the page:

> [`https://www.duckietown.org/site/your-token`](https://www.duckietown.org/site/your-token)

Note: It may take up to 5 minutes after first creating your account for a token to be generated.

## Tell the Duckietown Shell your token {#dt-account-set-token}

Use the command

    laptop $ dts tok set

and follow the prompt.

Then the following command should work:

    laptop $ dts challenges info

and give a similar output to:

    You are succesfully authenticated.

       name: ![Your name]
      login: ![username]

        uid: ![user ID]

## Troubleshooting

### "DTShell object has no attribute sprint" when using `dts tok set`

You have to completely reinstall `dts` and its commands. Do that by:

1. Delete the `~/.dt-shell` folder
2. Uninstall `dts` by running `pip uninstall duckietown-shell`
3. Reinstall `dts` by following the procedure in [Laptop Setup](#laptop-setup)
