# AMOD18 Project TBD {#demo-projecttbd status=draft}

This is the template for the description of a demo.

First, we describe what is needed, including:

* Robot hardware
* Number of Duckiebots
* Robot setup steps
* Duckietown hardware

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: Duckiebot in configuration ???

Requires: Camera calibration completed.

</div>

## Video of expected results {#demo-projecttbd-expected}

First, we show a video of the expected behavior (if the demo is succesful).

## Duckietown setup notes {#demo-projecttbd-duckietown-setup}

Here, describe the assumptions about the Duckietown, including:

* Layout (tiles types)
* Instrastructure (traffic lights, wifi networks, ...) required
* Weather (lights, ...)

Do not write instructions here. The instructions should be somewhere in [the part about Duckietowns](+opmanual_duckietown#duckietowns). Here, merely point to them.


## Duckiebot setup notes {#demo-projecttbd-duckiebot-setup}

Write here any special setup for the Duckiebot, if needed.


Do not write instructions here. The instructions should be somewhere in the appropriate setup part.


## Pre-flight checklist {#demo-projecttbd-pre-flight}

The pre-flight checklist describes the steps that are sufficient to
ensure that the demo will be correct:

Check: operation 1 done

Check: operation 2 done

## Demo instructions {#demo-projecttbd-run}

Here, give step by step instructions to reproduce the demo.

Step 1: XXX

Step 2: XXX


## Troubleshooting {#demo-projecttbd-troubleshooting}

Add here any troubleshooting / tips and tricks required.

## Demo failure demonstration {#demo-projecttbd-failure}

Finally, put here a video of how the demo can fail, when the assumptions are not respected.
