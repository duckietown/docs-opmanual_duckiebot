# Demo Obstavoid Algorithm {#demo-obstavoid status=beta}

## Demo description {#demo-obstavoid-description}

This demo will show the use of a new fully-functional drive controller. It can replace the current lane follower, as it is able to handle more general driving scenarios, mainly focusing on obstacles.

With the Obstavoid algorithm, the duckiebot (now denoted as the ‘actor’) will still try to follow its own lane, exactly like the lane follower implemented by default. The advantage of the Obstavoid algorithm is, that it takes into account every obstacle within a certain visibility range and planning horizon. The module continuously calculates an optimal trajectory to navigate along the road. If an obstacle blocks its way, the algorithm will decide on its own what maneuver will suit the best for the given situation. By predicting the motion of every obstacle and other duckiebots, the actor can, for example, be prepared for an inattentive duckie trying to cross the road, or decide if a passing maneuver is feasible with the current traffic situation, or if it should rather adjust its driving speed to wait until one of the lanes are free.

In this demo different scenarios are set up in a simulation, where you can test the Obstavoid algorithm to its full extent.


## The Obstavoid Algorithm {#demo-obstavoid-explained}

The Obstavoid algorithm is based on a shortest path optimisation problem, which seeks the best way through a weighted, three dimensional space-time grid. The three main pillars necessary for this problem setting are the design of a suitable cost function to define the actor’s behaviour, a graph search algorithm to determine the optimal trajectory and a sampler, which extracts the desired steering commands from a given trajectory and the actor’s position. In the following, each of these aspects will be further discussed and their implementation in the code architecture is briefly addressed.

### Cost function
There are three main goals the actor tries to fulfill when driving in the road. Firstly, the robot tries to stay within its own lane to obey traffic rules. Secondly, it wants to drive forwards, to not cause a traffic jam. Finally, the actor wants to avoid any collisions with an obstacle or other duckies. For the algorithm to work, these three requirements need to be modelled as a cost function for the solver to find an optimal trajectory with minimal cost along its path.
For the actor to stay within its own lane the cost was shaped with a 5th degree polynomial curve with a global minimum in the center of the right lane. Driving in the wrong lane results in a higher cost as it is not desired but only needed for a passing maneuver or to dodge an obstacle. Getting closer to the edge of the road is punished with an even higher cost as an accident with an innocent duckie would be unforgivable.

By reducing the cost linearly along the driving direction of the road, it is beneficial for the actor to drive forwards. Both road cost and driving cost are independent of time, so these will remain the same for any given driving scenario.

On the other hand, obstacles like other duckiebots cannot always be modelled statically. Consider a situation, where the actor tries to drive around an obstacle, which is blocking the road. It needs to be sure, that no other duckiebot will come across the left lane while conducting a passing maneuver. To be able to predict the future within a certain time horizon, the cost grid needs to be extended to a third dimension, now considering the factor of time.

The costs of each obstacle is modelled as a modified rotationally symmetrical bell curve. By considering the current velocity of a dynamic obstacle and assuming the speed and direction to remain the same, the position of the bell shaped cost function can be predicted for every time instance on the time-dependent cost function.

By simply adding these static costs with the cost of each obstacle together, a overall final cost is obtained. Once this final cost function has been found, it can now be discretized as a 5 x 6 x 6 grid (width x length x timesteps) in a defined box in front of the actor. The size of this grid has been evaluated, for the solver to be able to compute the trajectory within a 10th of a second, allowing for a sampling frequency of 10 Hz.

### Solver
To determine an optimal trajectory through the time-dependent cost grid the problem can be rephrased as a shortest path problem in a three-dimensional volume.

Firstly, the possible space-time positions (referred to as ‘nodes’) are connected using directional edges only, to ensure temporal causality. To minimize path search time and effort, edge connections are established only if they are physically feasible given the actor’s maximal velocity and sampling time of the discretization.

Secondly, in contrast to typical shortest path problems, not only the edge cost of traversing an edge between two nodes but also a node cost, which is the cost generated by visiting the corresponding node, has to be considered. As described in the first section, the node costs are determined by an intricate cost function, whereby the edge costs are weighted proportionally to their lengths, leading to a slight preference for actually shorter paths.

As our selected discretization parameters lead to a manageable number of 180 nodes and ca. 1’500 edges, an optimal solution with no heuristics is feasible: The go-to choice for this scenario is Dijkstra’s algorithm. Not only does it guarantee the path of optimal cost, but it determines it with great efficiency. Emerging from the application of the dynamic programming algorithm on a general, shortest path problem, it only pursues to search paths while they are lower in cost than the previously best result. Finally, after applying Dijkstra’s algorithm to our problem, we obtain a time-stamped trajectory over the entire planning horizon.

### Trajectory sampler
Given this trajectory, the actor now needs to follow it as smoothly as possible. To get a continuous trajectory, the discretely evaluated six time-stamped positions are linearized inbetween. At last, a trajectory follower calculates the linear and angular velocity commands to steer the robot.

### Optimality
What sets the Obstavoid Algorithm apart from a conventional trajectory optimizer is its inherent versatility: As the entire trajectory generation is one fluent process without any human-made case classifications, the transition between different driving maneuvers and actions happens without discrete switches. With this approach, a great variety of scenarios can be managed automatically, e.g. waiting for a passing maneuver while the other lane is blocked. This dynamic start-and-stop maneuvering strategy directly arises from the problem formulation, as it turns out that waiting before overtaking clearly has a lower cost than a crash or going back-and-forth.

In conclusion, with the Obstavoid Algorithm the human influence on scenario analysis, classification and corresponding trajectory generation shifts towards the high-level tasks of cost-function design, which is finally not only a question of engineering but rather of moral and ethics.

## Video of expected results {#demo-obstavoid-expected}

First, we show a video of the expected behavior (if the demo is succesful).

## Duckietown setup notes {#demo-obstavoid-duckietown-setup}

As this is only a demo in the simulation framework `duckietown-world` no setup of a real duckietown is needed.
