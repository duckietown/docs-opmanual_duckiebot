## Foreword

You can acquire Duckiebots in two ways.

* **Do it yourself** (`DB17`): the `DB17` Duckiebot configuration is made of components that you can source independently.

* **"One click" solution** (`DB18`): the `DB18` Duckiebot configuration includes some hardware upgrades that are custom made.

## Acquiring the parts for a `DB18` {#db-opmanual-get-db18 status=ready}

Note: This hardware can be acquired by contacting directly the [Duckietown project](https://www.duckietown.org/about/hardware).

The `DB18` configuration has the same functionalities of a fully equipped `DB17-l` Duckiebot.
