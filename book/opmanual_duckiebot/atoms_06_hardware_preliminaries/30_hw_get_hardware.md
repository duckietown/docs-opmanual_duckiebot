# Getting the Duckiebot hardware {#get-db-hw status=ready}

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: Knowledge of [Duckiebot hardware configurations](#duckiebot-configurations)

Results: Parts to assemble a Duckiebot.

</div>

## Foreword

You can acquire Duckiebots in two ways.

* **Do it yourself** (`DB17`): the `DB17` Duckiebot configuration is made of components that you can source independently.

* **"One click" solution** (`DB18`): the `DB18` Duckiebot configuration includes some hardware upgrades that are custom made.

## Acquiring the parts for a `DB18` {#db-opmanual-get-db18 status=ready}

Note: This hardware can be acquired by contacting directly the [Duckietown project](https://www.duckietown.org/about/hardware).

The `DB18` configuration has the same functionalities of a fully equipped `DB17-l` Duckiebot.

## Acquiring the parts for a `DB17` {#db-opmanual-get-db17 status=ready}

Here, we provide a link to all bits and pieces that are needed to build a `DB17-jwd` Duckiebot, along with the price tag.

In general, keep in mind that:

- The links might expire, or the prices might vary.
- Shipping times and fees vary, and are not included in the prices shown below.
- International deliveries are subject to additional custom clearances and import fees.
- Substitutions are OK for the mechanical components,
  and not OK for all the electronics, unless you are OK in writing
  some software. Limited technical support will be offered for hardware customizations.
- Buying the parts for more than one Duckiebot makes each one cheaper than buying only one.
- For some components, the links we provide contain more bits than actually needed.

<!--
<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: Cost: USD 174 + Shipping Fees (minimal configuration `DB17`)

Requires: Time: 15 days (average shipping to the USA for cheapest choice of components)

Results: A kit of parts ready to be assembled in a `DB17` or `DB17-wjd` configuration.

Next steps: After receiving these components, you are ready to do some [soldering](#assembling-duckiebot-db17-soldering) before [assembling](#assembling-duckiebot-db17-ttic) your `DB17` or `DB17-wjd` Duckiebot.

## Chassis

We selected the Magician Chassis as the basic chassis for the robot ([](#fig:magician_chassis)).

We chose it because it has a double-decker configuration, and so we can put the battery in the lower part.

The chassis pack includes 2 DC motors and wheels as well as the structural part, in addition to a screwdriver and several necessary mechanical bits (standoffs, screws and nuts).

<div figure-id="fig:magician_chassis" figure-caption="The Magician Chassis">
     <img src="magician_chassis.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

## Raspberry Pi 3 - Model B

Note: It is recommend to upgrade to Raspberry Pi 3 model B+. In this case the 5 GHz wireless adapter is no longer necessary.

The Raspberry Pi is the central computer of the Duckiebot. Duckiebots use Model B ([](#fig:rpi3b)) ( A 1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU, 1GB RAM), a small but powerful computer.

<div figure-id="fig:rpi3b" figure-caption="The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B">
     <img src="rpi3b.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

### Power Supply

We want a hard-wired power source (5VDC, 2.4A, Micro USB) to supply the Raspberry Pi ([](#fig:power_supply)) while not driving. This charger can double down as battery charger as well.

<div figure-id="fig:power_supply" figure-caption="The Power Supply">
     <img src="power_supply.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

### Heat Sinks

The Raspberry Pi will heat up significantly during use. It is warmly recommended to add heat sinks, as in  [](#fig:heat_sinks). Since we will be stacking HATs on top of the Raspberry Pi with 15 mm standoffs, the maximum height of the heat sinks should be well below 15 mm. The chip dimensions are 15x15mm and 10x10mm.

<div figure-id="fig:heat_sinks" figure-caption="The Heat Sinks">
     <img src="heat-sinks.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

###  Class 10 MicroSD Card

The MicroSD card ([](#fig:SDcard)) is the hard disk of the Raspberry Pi. 16 GB of capacity are sufficient for the system image.

<div figure-id="fig:SDcard" figure-caption="The MicroSD card">
     <img src="SDcard.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

###  Mirco SD card reader

A microSD card reader ([](#fig:microsd-reader)) is useful to copy the system image to a Duckiebot from a computer to the Raspberry Pi microSD card, when the computer does not have a native SD card slot.

<div figure-id="fig:microsd-reader" figure-caption="The Mirco SD card reader">
     <img src="microsd-reader.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

## Camera

The Camera is the main sensor of the Duckiebot. All versions equip a 5 Mega Pixels 1080p camera with wide field of view ($160^\circ$) fisheye lens ([](#fig:camera)).

<div figure-id="fig:camera" figure-caption="The Camera with Fisheye Lens">
     <img src="camera.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

### Camera Mount

The camera mount ([](#fig:camera_mount)) serves to keep the camera looking forward at the right angle to the road (looking slightly down). The front cover is not essential.

<div figure-id="fig:camera_mount" figure-caption="The Camera Mount">
     <img src="camera-mount.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

The assembled camera (without camera cable), is shown in ([](#fig:mounted-camera)).

<div figure-id="fig:mounted-camera" figure-caption="The Camera on its mount">
     <img src="mounted-camera.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

### 300mm Camera Cable

A longer (300 mm) camera cable [](#fig:long_camera_cable) makes assembling the Duckiebot easier, allowing for more freedom in the relative positioning of camera and computational stack.

<div figure-id="fig:long_camera_cable" figure-caption="A 300 mm camera cable for the Raspberry Pi">
     <img src="long_camera_cable.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

## DC Motor HAT

We use the DC Stepper motor HAT ([](#fig:motor_hat)) to control the DC motors that drive the wheels. This item will require [soldering](#assembling-duckiebot-db17-soldering) to be functional. This HAT has dedicate PWM and H-bridge for driving the motors.

<div figure-id="fig:motor_hat" figure-caption="The Stepper Motor HAT">
     <img src="motor_hat.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

### Stacking Headers

We use a long 20x2 GPIO stacking header ([](#figure:stacking_header)) to connect the Raspberry Pi with the DC Motor HAT. This item will require [soldering](#assembling-duckiebot-db17-soldering) to be functional.

<div figure-id="fig:stacking_header" figure-caption="The Stacking Headers">
     <img src="stacking_header.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

## Battery

The battery ([](#fig:battery)) provides power to the Duckiebot.

We choose this battery because it has a good combination of size (to fit in the lower deck of the Magician Chassis), high output amperage (2.4A and 2.1A at 5V DC) over two USB outputs, a good capacity (10400 mAh) at an affordable price. The battery linked in the table above comes with two USB to microUSB cables.

<div figure-id="fig:battery" figure-caption="The Battery">
     <img src="battery-and-cables.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

## Standoffs, Nuts and Screws

We use non electrically conductive standoffs (M2.5 12mm F 6mm M), nuts (M2.5), and screws (M2.5x10mm) to hold the Raspberry Pi to the chassis and the HATs stacked on top of the Raspberry Pi.

The Duckiebot requires 8 standoffs, 4 nuts and 4 screws.

<div figure-id="fig:stands_nuts_screws" figure-caption="Standoffs, Nuts and Screws">
     <img src="mech-bits.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

## Zip Tie

Two 300x5mm zip ties are needed to keep the battery at the lower deck from moving around.

<div figure-id="fig:zipties" figure-caption="The zip ties">
     <img src="zipties.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

## Configuration `DB17-w`

### Wireless Adapter (5 GHz)

The Edimax AC1200 EW-7822ULC 5 GHz wireless adapter ([](#fig:edimax)) boosts the connectivity of the Duckiebot, especially useful in busy Duckietowns (e.g., classroom). This additional network allows easy streaming of images.  

<div figure-id="fig:edimax" figure-caption="The Edimax AC1200 EW-7822ULC wifi adapter">
     <img src="edimax.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

This component is not necessary if upgrading to Raspberry Pi 3 Model B +.

## Configuration `DB17-j`

### Joypad

The joypad is used to manually remote control the Duckiebot. Any 2.4 GHz wireless controller (with a _tiny_ USB dongle) will do.

The model linked in the table ([](#fig:joystick)) does not include batteries.

<div figure-id="fig:joystick" figure-caption="A Wireless Joypad">
     <img src="joystick.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

Requires: 2 AA 1.5V batteries ([](#fig:batteries)) not included in the [bill of materials](#tab:materials).

<div figure-id="fig:batteries" figure-caption="A Wireless Joypad">
     <img src="batteries.jpg" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>


## Configuration `DB17-d`

###  Tiny 32GB USB Flash Drive

In configuration `DB17-d`, the Duckiebot is equipped with an "external" hard drive ([](#fig:USBdrive)). This add-on is very convenient to store logs during experiments and later port them to a workstation for analysis. It provides storage capacity and faster data transfer than the MicroSD card.

<div figure-id="fig:USBdrive" figure-caption="The Tiny 32GB USB Flash Drive">
     <img src="USBdrive.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

## Configuration `DB17-l`

## LEDs

This Duckiebot is equipped with 5 RGB LEDs ([](#figure:led)). LEDs can be used to signal to other Duckiebots, or just make _fancy_ patterns.

The pack of LEDs linked in the table above holds 10 LEDs, enough for two Duckiebots.

<div figure-id="fig:led" figure-caption="The RGB LEDs">
     <img src="led.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

### LED HAT

The LED HAT ([](#figure:led_hat)) provides an interface for our RGB LEDs and the computational stack. This board is a daughterboard for the Adafruit 16-Channel PWM/Servo HAT, and enables connection with additional gadgets such as [ADS1015 12 Bit 4 Channel ADC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1083), [Monochrome 128x32 I2C OLED graphic display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/931), and [Adafruit 9-DOF IMU Breakout - L3GD20H+LSM303](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1714). This item will require [soldering](#assembling-duckiebot-db17-soldering).

This board is custom designed and can only be ordered in minimum runs of 3 pieces. The price scales down quickly with quantity, and lead times may be significant, so it is better to buy these boards in bulk.

<div figure-id="fig:led_hat" figure-caption="The LED HAT">
     <img src="led_hat.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

### PWM/Servo HAT

The PWM/Servo HAT ([](#figure:servo_hat)) mates to the LED HAT and provides the signals to control the LEDs, without taking computational resources away from the Rasperry Pi itself. This item will require [soldering](0_5_soldering_boards_c1.md).

<div figure-id="fig:servo_hat" figure-caption="The PWM-Servo HAT">
     <img src="servo_hat.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

### Power Cable

To power the PWM/Servo HAT from the battery, we use a short (30cm) angled male USB-A to 5.5/2.1mm DC power jack cable ([](#figure:power-cable-usb-to-jack)).

<div figure-id="fig:power-cable-usb-to-jack" figure-caption="The 30cm angled USB to 5.5/2.1mm power jack cable.">
     <img src="power-cable-usb-to-jack.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

### Male-Male Jumper Wires

The Duckiebot needs one male-male jumper wire ([](#figure:mm_wires)) to power the DC Stepper Motor HAT from the PWM/Servo HAT.

<div figure-id="fig:mm_wires" figure-caption="Premier Male-Male Jumper Wires">
     <img src="mm_wires.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>


### Female-Female Jumper Wires

20 Female-Female Jumper Wires ([](#figure:ff_wires)) are necessary to connect 5 LEDs to the LED HAT.

<div figure-id="fig:ff_wires" figure-caption="Premier Female-Female Jumper Wires">
     <img src="ff_wires.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

## Bumpers

These bumpers are designed to keep the LEDs in place and are therefore used only in configuration `DB17-l`. They are custom designed parts, so they must be produced and cannot be bought. We used laser cutting facilities.
<!--
Our design files are available [here].
-->
<!--div figure-id="fig:bumpers" figure-caption="The Bumpers">
     <img src="placeholder.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div-->

## Headers, resistors and jumper

Upgrading `DB17` to `DB17-l` requires several electrical bits: 5 of 4 pin female header, 2 of 16 pin male headers, 1 of 12 pin male header, 1 of 3 pin male header, 1 of 2 pin female shunt jumper, 5 of 200 Ohm resistors and finally 10 of 130 Ohm resistors.

These items require [soldering](0_5_soldering_boards_c1.md).

<!--div figure-id="fig:headers" figure-caption="The Headers">
     <img src="placeholder.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div-->

<!--div figure-id="fig:resistors" figure-caption="The Resistors">
     <img src="placeholder.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div-->

## Caster (`DB17-c`) {#db17-c-description status=ready}

The caster ([](#fig:caster)) is an `DB17-c` component that substitutes the steel omni-directional wheel that comes in the Magician Chassis package. Although the caster is not essential, it provides smoother operations and overall enhanced Duckiebot performance.

<div figure-id="fig:caster" figure-caption="The caster wheel">
     <img src="caster.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

To assemble the caster at the right height we will need to purchase:

- 4 standoffs (M3 12mm F-F) ([](#fig:caster-standoffs)),
- 8 screws (M3x8mm) ([](#fig:caster-screws)), and
- 8 split lock washers ([](#fig:caster-split-washer)).

<div figure-id="fig:caster-bits">
    <figcaption>Mechanical bits to assemble the caster wheel.</figcaption>

    <div figure-id="subfig:caster-standoffs" figure-caption="Standoffs for caster wheel.">
        <img src="caster-standoffs.png" style='width: 25em'/>
    </div>

    <div figure-id="subfig:caster-screws" figure-caption="Screws for caster wheel.">
        <img src="caster-screws.png" style='width: 25em'/>

        <img src="caster-split-washer.png" style='width: 25em'/>
    </div>
</div>

Note: The caster wheel use is to be considered experimental and has been dropped in official configurations starting from `DB18`.
