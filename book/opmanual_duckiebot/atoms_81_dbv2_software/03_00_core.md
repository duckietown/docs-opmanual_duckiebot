# Core DBV2 {#dbv2-core status=beta}

The repository [`dt-core-dbv2`](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-core-dbv2) contains the new autonomous behaviours
added for DBV2. Similarly to `dt-core`, this container depends upon `dt-duckiebot-interface-dbv2` and
`dt-car-interface-dbv2`.

To use this container, follow the directions in [](#dbv2-demos).

## Launchfile changes

The `master.launch` file in `dt-core-dbv2` contains only very minor changes from that in `dt-core`. Specifcally,
the following arguments were added:

 - `/lane_following/lane_controller_launch_file`
 - `/vehicle_avoidance/vehicle_avoidance_control_node_launchfile`
 
These arguments allow the DBV2 to replace the original nodes with nodes which provide the same functionality
for DBV2. For example, the `lane_controller_launch_file` is used in 2 different ways: In one case, it is used
to provide the DBV2 version of the lane controller which uses the camera. In the other case, it is used to
provide the line follower lane control node ([](#dbv2-core-line-follower)).

This pattern can be extended in the future for other demos which need to replace existing nodes with new ones.
